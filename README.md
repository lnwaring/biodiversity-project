# Biodiversity in National Parks

#### Summary

This project explores species biodiversity across U.S. National Parks. The aim was to analyse the distribution of species, identify trends among endangered species, and test whether conservation efforts have had a statistically significant impact on protection status.

#### Tools & Skills Used:
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Data visualisation (Natplotlib, Seaborn)
- Statistical hypothesis testing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

#### Key Insights:
- The majority of at-risk species fall into the ‘Species of Concern’ category, with birds being the most represented species category in this group.
- Mammals and birds are the most protected groups across the national parks.
- Statistical testing revealed differences in protection rates across categories, highlighting where conservation efforts may be more or less effective.

#### Data Source

The data for this project was provided by Codecademy. While inspired by real-world biodiversity data, it has been adapted for educational purposes and includes some fictional elements.

#### How to View
- Open `biodiversity-project-FINAL.ipynb` in Jupyter or any compatible notebook viewer to explore the analysis and findings.
